"Earthquake Road Crack Detection" Kaggle competition released !

On February 6, 2023, a major earthquake occurred in Türkiye. One of the biggest problems after the earthquake was the cracks and deterioration in the roads. Therefore, there were many problems in the delivery of aid.

The "Earthquake Road Crack Detection" competition is a computer vision challenge that aimed at developing algorithms to immediately and automatically detect roads damaged by aerial imagery after affected by earthquakes. The goal of the competition is to build a model that can accurately identify and locate cracks in the images, which can help in the assessment of the damage caused by earthquakes and the planning of repair and maintenance activities. The detection of damaged roads immediately after an earthquake using aerial imaging is crucial in order to ensure immediate access to disaster area. The rescue rate decreases rapidly after the first 24 hours. That's why it is very important for the authorities to reach the affected areas as soon as possible. With the outcome of this project, the damage to roads in the x and y coordinates can be identified using satellite images and aerial imaging methods such as drones. The road repair and maintenance teams can then be directed immediately and follow-up aid can reach the earthquake area more quickly.

We are starting this voluntary project to do our best after the earthquake. We will present the project to the authorities and create a text with the names of everyone who participated.

Not only for the earthquake in Türkiye , but we will also share the model that emerged for use in many countries as open source. We are also working on this project ourselves. While doing this, we thought of the idea of why not work together with everyone the rest of the world and that's why we opening this competition. The winning solutions will not only demonstrate the cutting-edge technology in computer vision, but also have the potential to impact real-world applications in the field of road assessment and maintenance.

We thank to everyone who voluntarily participates in this competition. And we share the problems related to our topic on Kaggle Competition Description Page.

In addition, we have more post and pre earthquake projects in the future.

First one is to detect damaged buildings (cracked).

Second is to detect damaged structures such as bridges, viaducts, dams etc.

We will collect data as much as possible and open a separate competition for these as well.

If you know any data for these 3 projects, we would be very happy if you shared it with us. We will also share everything with you such as researches, articles etc. Please share with us as well. For example, in wall crack detection Maduo crack dataset can be used. When we start that project, we will touch on that subject. Earthquake is a world problem not just Türkiye's. Let's make the world a better place together!
